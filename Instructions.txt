To run the web application, you should first install all required libraries with the command : "pip install streamlit streamlit-folium folium requests pandas numpy scikit-learn osmnx geopandas shapely". Make sure the file Option_Base.csv is in the same folder as app.py. Once everything is installed, start the application by running "streamlit run app.py" in your terminal, and the interface will open in your browser.
